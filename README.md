# Invite Full Stack

## Description

The goal is to create an evite type of program which will display 1 user at a time and then you can select yes or no on whether to invite them. It will use the random person generator
[api](https://randomuser.me/) to display each person to show.

## Requirements

### Front End

- Layout the pages as shown in the screen shots below.
- There will be 3 pages invite, going and notgoing.
- Invite Page
  - Use Ajax to call your express application and display 1 [random user](https://randomuser.me/) as someone to invite or not
  - Show the user buttons to accept or reject the user
  - Show the counts of those going and those not going as provided from the back end
  - When clicked the button should submit the random user's data to the back end via a post call
- Going/Not Going
  - Display all the users who are going or not going depending on the page
  - Layout as shown in the screenshot
